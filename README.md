Smart Irrigation System

Implemented a 2 layer ML perceptron model for regression that took temperature and humidity values from IoT sensors
and produced waterflow percentage as output.
Also used photoresistor(LDR) sensor to detect light and turn off irrigation system at night.
Deployed it on arduino mega 2560 board and created a simulation on wokwi that can be acccesed here
